      <p className="media">My primary goal is to provide efficient client care. I am conscious and extremely sensitive to the various demographics presented in the gym. I routinely search the evidence for optimal exercise methods and interventions for each client or problem. Although prepared in a variety of bodies of knowledge, I specialise in applied biomechanics as it relates to programme design and corrective exercise. I can evaluate your movement and identify flaws in technique to not only mitigate the risk of injury but also ensure youâ€™re moving efficiently.</p>
